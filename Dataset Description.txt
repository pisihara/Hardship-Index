DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:
The paper contains the results of an analysis of the hardship index of Chicago’s 77 community areas. The data set contains data provided by the UIC Great Cities Institute.  Work on this data by a team of 2 professors, 10 students, and 1 urban studies staff member exemplifies 4 recommendations: make sure students understand the historical factors which have led to current community area hardship; probe beneath scatterplots showing improvement of raw indicators; compare normalization vs. standardization of raw indicators; and emphasize that a single index cannot capture all dimensions of hardship.
